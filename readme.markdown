## <a name=what></a>What
 
- A simple weather app web page.  Currently displays best on standard PC/laptop monitors. And maybe some tablets, with at 10" or larger displays.  I don't use or have a smart phone, so YMMV with such a device.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## <a name=why></a>Why

- Because I was tired of slow loading weather web sites bloated with tons of worthless bait-click crap & "fancy" features that nobody cares about. And by nobody, I mean me.
  (Actually, I'm tired of all slow loading web sites, which seems to be most of them anymore, but I can't re-write the entire web.  One little app is tuff enough...)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## <a name=requirements></a>Requirements

- A web browser to view, and, currently, a website to host the app (it is a single file), or a computer with an Apache/PHP stack installed.  And, as mentioned in "What" above, a decent sized monitor.  Or, a small screen and a magnifying glass and a stylus.

- As for browser versions, I only use a fork of Firefox (Light). So, again, YMMV.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## <a name=installation></a>Installation

1) Get D-weather. 

2) Use D-weather.
  
2a)If other default locations are desired, obtain their latitude, logitude, and radar ID, then edit D-weather were appropriate.  Detailed instructions may be added in the future.

## <a name=future></a>The Future...

-  The radar images currently used are only for about the last hour.  weather.gov has up to (about) three hours of radar images available at any given moment (in 5 to 10 minute increments).  However, those are only avaiable as individual layers: a base map, countly lines, highways, a legend, and the actual radar layer. 

  The plan is to be able to incorporate the layered images so the prior three hours of radar images can be viewed.  However, the downside is the base layer seems to be only available as a "topo" type map, and not a simple & cleaner looking "flat" map.  So, we'll see...

- Improve the layout & CSS so that small display devices (such as "smart" phones) can use D-Weather.

- If possible, re-write logic entirely in javascript (without PHP - will still use HTML & CSS of course) so that it can work stand-alone from a local PC/device, instead of from a website or PC with an Apache-PHP web stack installed.

- The world will end.

- The sun will end.

- The universe will end.

- Or will it??...

## [Git Log](https://raw.github.com/Self-Evident/D-Weather/gh-pages/master-branch.git.log)

Initial commit.  Includes, for posterity and archaeological examination, a year's+ worth of actual file versions, all created before deciding to use git.  Which was a few weeks ago.  But I just got around to gitting today.
